              <p>I am currently a student in the Software Engineering Technology program
                at Centennial College, where I am developing strong skills in Java, Python,
                C#, and web development. I am passionate about using technology to create
                innovative solutions that improve everyday life. I have experience working
                on various projects and I am excited to continue growing as a software developer.
                I am fluent in English, French, Persian, Urdu, and Hindi, which helps me communicate
                effectively in diverse environments.</p>
