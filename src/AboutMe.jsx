            <p>Hello, my name is Maaz Bobat, a 19-year-old student currently studying Artificial Intelligence - Software Engineering Technology at Centennial College. I'm born and raised in Toronto, and ever since I was a little kid, I've found computers and coding fascinating. In my journey as a student, I'm driven by a deep curiosity to explore the endless possibilities of technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.</p>
